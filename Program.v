(** ** Syntax  *)

(** We can add variables to the arithmetic expressions we had before by
    simply adding one more constructor: *)

Inductive aexp : Type :=
  | ANum : Z -> aexp
  | AId : id -> aexp
  | APlus : aexp -> aexp -> aexp
  | AMinus : aexp -> aexp -> aexp
  | AMult : aexp -> aexp -> aexp.

(** Defining a few variable names as notational shorthands will make
    examples easier to read: *)

Definition W : id := Id "W".
Definition X : id := Id "X".
Definition Y : id := Id "Y".

(** (This convention for naming program variables ([X], [Y],
    [Z]) clashes a bit with our earlier use of uppercase letters for
    types.  Since we're not using polymorphism heavily in the chapters
    devoped to Imp, this overloading should not cause confusion.) *)

(** The definition of [bexp]s is unchanged (except for using the new
    [aexp]s): *)

Inductive bexp : Type :=
  | BTrue : bexp
  | BFalse : bexp
  | BEq : aexp -> aexp -> bexp
  | BLe : aexp -> aexp -> bexp
  | BNot : bexp -> bexp
  | BAnd : bexp -> bexp -> bexp.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evaluation *)

(** The arith and boolean evaluators are extended to handle
    variables in the obvious way, taking a state as an extra
    argument: *)

Fixpoint aeval (st : state) (a : aexp) : Z :=
  match a with
  | ANum n => n
  | AId x => st x
  | APlus a1 a2 => (aeval st a1) + (aeval st a2)
  | AMinus a1 a2  => (aeval st a1) - (aeval st a2)
  | AMult a1 a2 => (aeval st a1) * (aeval st a2)
  end.

Fixpoint beval (st : state) (b : bexp) : bool :=
  match b with
  | BTrue       => true
  | BFalse      => false
  | BEq a1 a2   => Z.eqb (aeval st a1) (aeval st a2)
  | BLe a1 a2   => Z.leb (aeval st a1) (aeval st a2)
  | BNot b1     => negb (beval st b1)
  | BAnd b1 b2  => andb (beval st b1) (beval st b2)
  end.

Example aexp1 :
  aeval (t_update empty_state X 5)
        (APlus (ANum 3) (AMult (AId X) (ANum 2)))
  = 13.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

  = true.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Commands *)

(** Now we are ready define the syntax and behavior of Imp
    _commands_ (sometimes called _statements_). *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Syntax *)

(** Informally, commands [c] are described by the following BNF
    grammar.  (We choose this slightly awkward concrete syntax for the
    sake of being able to define Imp syntax using Coq's Notation
    mechanism.  In particular, we use [IFB] to avoid conflicting with
    the [if] notation from the standard library.)

     c ::= SKIP | x ::= a | c ;; c | IFB b THEN c ELSE c FI
         | WHILE b DO c END
*)
(**
    For example, here's factorial in Imp:

     Z ::= X;;
     Y ::= 1;;
     WHILE not (Z = 0) DO
       Y ::= Y * Z;;
       Z ::= Z - 1
     END

   When this command terminates, the variable [Y] will contain the
   factorial of the initial value of [X]. *)

(** Here is the formal definition of the abstract syntax of
    commands: *)

Inductive com : Type :=
  | CSkip : com
  | CAss : id -> aexp -> com
  | CSeq : com -> com -> com
  | CIf : bexp -> com -> com -> com
  | CWhile : bexp -> com -> com.

(** As usual, we can use a few [Notation] declarations to make things
    more readable.  To avoid conflicts with Coq's built-in notations,
    we keep this light -- in particular, we don't introduce any
    notations for [aexps] and [bexps] to avoid confusion with the
    numeric and boolean operators we've already defined. *)

Notation "'SKIP'" :=
  CSkip.
Notation "x '::=' a" :=
  (CAss x a) (at level 60).
Notation "c1 ;; c2" :=
  (CSeq c1 c2) (at level 80, right associativity).
Notation "'WHILE' b 'DO' c 'END'" :=
  (CWhile b c) (at level 80, right associativity).
Notation "'IFB' c1 'THEN' c2 'ELSE' c3 'FI'" :=
  (CIf c1 c2 c3) (at level 80, right associativity).

(** For example, here is the factorial function again, written as a
    formal definition to Coq: *)

(* Definition fact_in_coq : com :=
  Z ::= AId X;;
  Y ::= ANum 1;;
  WHILE BNot (BEq (AId Z) (ANum 0)) DO
    Y ::= AMult (AId Y) (AId Z);;
    Z ::= AMinus (AId Z) (ANum 1)
  END. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** More Examples *)

(** Assignment: *)

Definition plus2 : com :=
  X ::= (APlus (AId X) (ANum 2)).

Definition XtimesYinZ : com :=
  Z ::= (AMult (AId X) (AId Y)).

Definition subtract_slowly_body : com :=
  Z ::= AMinus (AId Z) (ANum 1) ;;
  X ::= AMinus (AId X) (ANum 1).

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Loops *)

Definition subtract_slowly : com :=
  WHILE BNot (BEq (AId X) (ANum 0)) DO
    subtract_slowly_body
  END.

Definition subtract_3_from_5_slowly : com :=
  X ::= ANum 3 ;;
  Z ::= ANum 5 ;;
  subtract_slowly.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** An infinite loop: *)

Definition loop : com :=
  WHILE BTrue DO
    SKIP
  END.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Evaluating Commands *)

(** Next we need to define what it means to evaluate an Imp command.
    The fact that [WHILE] loops don't necessarily terminate makes defining
    an evaluation function tricky... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evaluation as a Function (Failed Attempt) *)

(** Here's an attempt at defining an evaluation function for commands,
    omitting the [WHILE] case. *)

Fixpoint ceval_fun_no_while (st : state) (c : com)
                          : state :=
  match c with
    | SKIP =>
        st
    | x ::= a1 =>
        t_update st x (aeval st a1)
    | c1 ;; c2 =>
        let st' := ceval_fun_no_while st c1 in
        ceval_fun_no_while st' c2
    | IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI =>
        if (beval st b)
          then ceval_fun_no_while st c1
          else ceval_fun_no_while st c2
    | WHILE b DO c END =>
        st  (* bogus *)
  end.

(** In a traditional functional programming language like OCaml or
    Haskell we could add the [WHILE] case as follows:

  Fixpoint ceval_fun (st : state) (c : com) : state :=
    match c with
      ...
      | WHILE b DO c END =>
          if (beval st b)
            then ceval_fun st (c; WHILE b DO c END)
            else st
    end.

    Coq doesn't accept such a definition ("Error: Cannot guess
    decreasing argument of fix") because the function we want to
    define is not guaranteed to terminate. Indeed, it _doesn't_ always
    terminate: for example, the full version of the [ceval_fun]
    function applied to the [loop] program above would never
    terminate. Since Coq is not just a functional programming
    language but also a consistent logic, any potentially
    non-terminating function needs to be rejected. Here is
    an (invalid!) program showing what would go wrong if Coq
    allowed non-terminating recursive functions:

         Fixpoint loop_false (n : nat) : False := loop_false n.

    That is, propositions like [False] would become provable
    ([loop_false 0] would be a proof of [False]), which
    would be a disaster for Coq's logical consistency.

    Thus, because it doesn't terminate on all inputs,
    of [ceval_fun] cannot be written in Coq -- at least not without
    additional tricks and workarounds (see chapter [ImpCEvalFun]
    if you're curious about what those might be). *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evaluation as a Relation *)

(** Here's a better way: define [ceval] as a _relation_ rather than a
    _function_ -- i.e., define it in [Prop] instead of [Type], as we
    did for [aevalR] above. *)

(** This is an important change.  Besides freeing us from awkward
    workarounds, it gives us a lot more flexibility in the definition.
    For example, if we add nondeterministic features like [any] to the
    language, we want the definition of evaluation to be
    nondeterministic -- i.e., not only will it not be total, it will
    not even be a function! *)

(** We'll use the notation [c / st \\ st'] for the [ceval] relation:
    [c / st \\ st'] means that executing program [c] in a starting
    state [st] results in an ending state [st'].  This can be
    pronounced "[c] takes state [st] to [st']". *)

(** *** Operational Semantics *)

(** Here is an informal definition of evaluation, presented as inference
    rules for readability:

(** ** Determinism of Evaluation *)

(** Changing from a computational to a relational definition of
    evaluation is a good move because it frees us from the artificial
    requirement that evaluation should be a total function.  But it
    also raises a question: Is the second definition of evaluation
    really a partial function?  Or is it possible that, beginning from
    the same state [st], we could evaluate some command [c] in
    different ways to reach two different output states [st'] and
    [st'']?
